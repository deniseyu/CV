I am a full-stack web developer and designer who likes building applications with intuitive user stories, encapsulated code, and comprehensive testing. From September 15, 2014 to December 5, 2014, I completed a 12-week web development course at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com). I am currently seeking a junior developer role in London, New York, San Francisco, Boulder, or Denver.

My non-coding interests include policy design, behavioral sciences, parliamentary debating, and contemplating the economics of the zombie apocalypse. My academic background is social policy, philosophy, and economics. In my spare time, I like to take photographs, play the piano, and create spontaneous art projects.
